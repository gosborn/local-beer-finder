# local-beer-finder

Sinatra app that uses info parsed from BreweryDB to randomly generate beer info based on current state.

Uses ActiveRecord to maintain data for states, breweries and beer.

Features that could be added: defintiely some front-end styling, some session persistence to save favorited beers, a age verifier
