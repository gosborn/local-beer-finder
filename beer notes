beer notes

how about saving beer to a list?
how about asking for a particular type?
how about asking for more or less abv, ibu?


beer = open('http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/?key=dd604aa40606566d3f9fcba2c8ff7d8c')

http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/brewery/P1I1gt/beers?key=86218246293bbfe86b588c02dbad2206

in browser, this address will get you all the beers from Buffalo Bill's Brewery



beer_from_buffalo_bills_brewery = JSON.load(RestClient.get('http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/brewery/P1I1gt/beers?key=86218246293bbfe86b588c02dbad2206')

to get a random beer from this hash

newbeer["data"].sample["name"]

seasonal information

beer = newbeer["data"].sample

beer["available"]["name"] == "Seasonal"

using brewerydb gem

beers in new york

newyorks = b.locations.all(region: 'New York')

random beer from new york

newyorks.first["brewery_id"]

hola = JSON.load(RestClient.get('http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/brewery/nuhnAb/beers?key=86218246293bbfe86b588c02dbad2206'))

hola["data"].sample["name"]

so, do we need to use brewery_db at all?


locations = http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/locations?key=dd604aa40606566d3f9fcba2c8ff7d8c

http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/locations?region=alabama&key=dd604aa40606566d3f9fcba2c8ff7d8c

could build program to build a database in seeds.rb!

state has many locations/breweries
  name

breweries have many beers
  state_id
  name
  address


state has many beers through breweries
  brewery_id
  description
  abv
  ibu

  availability?
